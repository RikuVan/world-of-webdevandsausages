# ufw supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
# against brute-force login attacks. ufw will deny connections if an IP
# address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last
# 30 seconds. See  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
# for details. Typical usage is:
- name: Set throttle limit
  become: yes
  ufw:
    rule: limit
    port: ssh
    proto: tcp

# Allow OpenSSH. (Note that as ufw manages its own state, simply removing
# a rule=allow task can leave those ports exposed. Either use delete=yes
# or a separate state=reset task)
- name: Allow OpenSSH
  become: yes
  ufw:
    rule: allow
    name: OpenSSH

- name: Deny everything and enable UFW
  become: yes
  ufw:
    state: enabled
    policy: deny
