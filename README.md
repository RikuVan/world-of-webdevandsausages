# `webdevandsausages.org`

## Who are we

Web Dev and Sausages is a meetup based in Tampere, Finland. Join us. We do cool-ass events and code stuff.

## What this repo for

Maintaining our event registration tool, currently deployed to a server in Digital Ocean, as well as our client, and other packages in this mono-repo.
See individual package READMEs for details about the package.

## Setting up dev environment

To set up the development environment you will need the `wds-event-tool` (backend) and `wds-client` packages. The backend requires the addition of two files with api keys that are not under source control. They should be placed under `src/main/resources`. Please contact us for these if you would like to contribute to the project.

## Contributing

Please do lend a hand to improve our services in any way you can think of. Please make an issue or a pr.
